This is the Unofficial Official Trench Crusade repository for the NewRecruit roster builder. We are not officially associated with anyone at Trench Crusade, but we do show up automatically in NewRecruit!

This project is focused on enforcing legal standards of lists. Admittedly some of what is and is not legal in the rules gets pretty vague so I have to use my discretion.

If you have created a fork of this repository for the purpose of Homebrew, please get in touch; I would love to list your work here for visibility.
